# JDK 11

* 2021-09-10 - proposed

# Context
JDK 16 have restricted the usage of `deep reflection`. This is (sadly) used in some parts of a few of the libraries we depend on.

It should be possible to use `--add-opens` flag to allow usage of deep reflection in JDK 16. An attempt have been made to configure this in Gradle, but without success.

Kotest have a nice feature for setting environment variable. 
This is possible in both JDK 11 and JDK 16, but with JDK 16 we can then no longer run a single kotest.

Other kotlin libraries have also reported the same issue with deep reflection in JDK 16.

## Decision
Use JDK 11 until newer jdk versions are necessary, then we can figure out how to configure gradle to add-opens.

## Consequences JDK 11
- Miss out on some security updates
- Miss out on some runtime optimalization

## Consequences JDK 16
- Larger image, hence possible slower build times
- Can no longer run a single test at the time while using withEnvironemnt()
