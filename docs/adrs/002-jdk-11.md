# JDK 11

* 2021-09-08 - proposed

# Context
JDK 16 have restricted the usage of `deep reflection`. This is (sadly) used in some parts of a few of the libraries we depend on (test libs primarily).

The docs say it is possible to use java arg `--add-opens`, but the current attempts in doing this with Â´Ggradle have failed.

## Decision
Use JDK 11 that allows deep reflection.

## Consequences
We will miss out on some optimalization and security.

### JDK 11 vs JDK 16
Allows us to use withEnvironment(<map>) { <test> } in the tests.

The size of the JDK is smaller than jdk16, that saves some time and space in the name of build/test/CI

JDK 11 is primarily used by the Kotlin community.
